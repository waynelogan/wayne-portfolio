						An artistic full stack developer (frontend heavy) with over 3 years of experience in designing
						and developing artsy, intuitive and accessible web apps that meet customer needs and achieve
						business objectives. I do this using modern technologies including TypeScript, React/Next JS, Tailwind CSS/Chakra UI,
						Figma and Git/GitHub among others.
					</p>
					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600 text-lg">
						I specialize in building highly performant and graphics rich User Interfaces that deliver on
						usability and aesthetics. This comes from my vast experience in writing quality code collaboratively
						in a Scrum based Agile team for several years. I believe that what makes me great at what I do is:
						my work ethic, my knowledge of appropriate tools and technologies, and the ability to learn and adapt
						to current demands.
					</p>
					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600 text-lg">
						I am an avid learner of web technologies and I pride myself being an early adopter âš¡ of the Next JS framework, and Shadcn UI library .
						Beyond web design and development, I also practice as an embedded systems engineer(ing student),
						which is my second love ðŸ’—.
